# en-US Folder

This folder contains two flat JSON files with 100 key-value pairs each:

- `file1.json`: Keys are in the format `key1`, `key2`, ..., `key100`.
- `file2.json`: Keys are in the format `item1`, `item2`, ..., `item100`.

Each file is intended for demonstration or localization purposes. All values are simple string values.

Feel free to modify or use these files as needed for your project.
